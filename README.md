## Patika.dev Backend Web Development with Java

Course by [Patika.dev](https://www.patika.dev/) and [Kodluyoruz](https://www.kodluyoruz.org/) 

All work and projects done for the course will be in this repository. 

I'm still getting used to using IntelliJ IDEA, and somehow created another branch. Please also check "master" branch.
